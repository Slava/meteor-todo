metheor-todo
============

Slava's test application using meteor.js. It has some small bugs, but it gives overall idea.

By initial idea, all functional code should be in model.js, server specific code in server.js, client specific in client.js.

Started and finished Jan 10 2013, one day project for looking at meteor. Meteor is Preview v.0.5.4.
